### MAKE A MINECRAFT WOODEN PICKAXE WITH PYTHON ###
''' 
Let's make a Wooden Pickaxe! We will use lists to put our items in the crafting grid. This recipe calls for 3 Planks (we'll use Oak), and 2 Sticks. We have to arrange our crafting materials the right way to get our Wooden Pickaxe. The table below shows how the materials go together:

+-crafting_grid-------------------------+
| +-row_1-----+-----------+-----------+ |
| | Oak Plank | Oak Plank | Oak Plank | |
| +-row_2-----+-----------+-----------+ |
| |           |   Stick   |           | |
| +-row_3-----+-----------+-----------+ |
| |           |   Stick   |           | |
| +-----------+-----------+-----------+ |
+---------------------------------------+

To beat this challenge and get the Wooden Pickaxe, you will need to make 4 lists:
    crafting_grid (the outer box above)
    row_1
    row_2
    row_3

Next, add the correct crafting materials to each row.

Then, add the rows in the right order to the crafting_grid.

Finally, call the function craft_pickaxe(crafting_grid) to see if you got the Wooden Pickaxe or if you need to try again!
